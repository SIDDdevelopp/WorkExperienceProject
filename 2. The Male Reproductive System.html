        <h1 align="center"><u>3.1 THE MALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM</u></h1><br>
        <p>The male reproductive system is located in the pelvis region
            (Figure 3.1a). It includes a pair of <b>testes</b> alongwith
            <b>accessory ducts, glands</b> and the <b>external genitalia.</b>
            <br>
            The testes are situated outside the abdominal cavity within a pouch called <b>scrotum.</b> The scrotum helps
in maintaining the low temperature
of the testes (2 - 2.5o C lower than
the normal internal body
temperature) necessary for
spermatogenesis. In adults, each
testis is oval in shape, with a length
of about 4 to 5 cm and a width of
about 2 to 3 cm. The testis is
covered by a dense covering. Each
testis has about 250 compartments
called <b>testicular lobules</b>
(Figure 3.1b).<br><br>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Each lobule contains one to
three highly coiled <b>seminiferous
    tubules</b> in which sperms are
    produced. Each seminiferous tubule
    is lined on its inside by two types
    of cells called <b>male germ cells</b>
    (spermatogonia) and <b>Sertoli cells</b>
    (Figure 3.2 ). The male germ cells
    undergo meiotic divisions finally
    leading to sperm formation, while
    Sertoli cells provide nutrition to the
    germ cells. The regions outside the
    seminiferous tubules called
    interstitial spaces, contain small
    blood vessels and <b>interstitial cells</b>
    or <b>Leydig cells</b> (Figure 3.2). Leydig
    cells synthesise and secrete
    testicular hormones called
    androgens. Other immunologically
    competent cells are also present.<br>

    The male sex accessory ducts include <b>rete testis, vasa efferentia,
        epididymis</b> and <b>vas deferens</b> (Figure 3.1b). The seminiferous tubules of
    the testis open into the vasa efferentia through rete testis. The vasa efferentia
    leave the testis and open into epididymis located along the posterior surface
    of each testis. The epididymis leads to vas deferens that ascends to the
    abdomen and loops over the urinary bladder. It receives a duct from seminal
        vesicle and opens into urethra as the ejaculatory duct (Figure 3.1a). These
        ducts store and transport the sperms from the testis to the outside through
        urethra. The urethra originates from the urinary bladder and extends
        through the penis to its external opening called <b>urethral meatus</b>.<br>
    The penis is the male external genitalia (Figure 3.1a, b). It is made up
        of special tissue that helps in erection of the penis to facilitate insemination.
        The enlarged end of penis called the glans penis is covered by a loose fold
        of skin called <b>foreskin</b>.<br>
        The male accessory glands (Figure 3.1a, b) include paired <b>seminal
        vesicles</b>, a <b>prostate</b> and paired <b>bulbourethral </b>glands. Secretions of these
        glands constitute the seminal plasma which is rich in fructose, calcium
        and certain enzymes. The secretions of bulbourethral glands also helps
        in the lubrication of the penis.</p><br>
