        <p>The reproductive cycle in the female primates (e.g. monkeys, apes and
            human beings) is called menstrual cycle. The first menstruation begins
            at puberty and is called <b>menarche</b>. In human females, menstruation
            is repeated at an average interval of about 28/29 days, and the cycle of
            events starting from one menstruation till the next one is called the
            <b>menstrual cycle</b>. One ovum is released (ovulation) during the middle
            of each menstrual cycle. The major events of the menstrual cycle are
shown in Figure 3.9.<br>

The cycle starts with the menstrual phase, when
menstrual flow occurs and it lasts for 3-5 days. The menstrual flow
results due to breakdown of endometrial lining of the uterus and its
blood vessels which forms liquid that comes out through vagina.
Menstruation only occurs if the released ovum is not fertilised. Lack of
menstruation may be indicative of pregnancy. However, it may also be
caused due to some other underlying causes like stress, poor health etc.
The menstrual phase is followed by the follicular phase. During
this phase, the primary follicles in the ovary grow to become a
fully mature Graafian follicle and simultaneously the endometrium
of uterus regenerates through proliferation. These changes in the
ovary and the uterus are induced by changes in the levels of
pituitary and ovarian hormones (Figure 3.9). The secretion of
gonadotropins (LH and FSH) increases gradually during the follicular
phase, and stimulates follicular development as well as secretion of
estrogens by the growing follicles. Both LH and FSH attain a peak level
in the middle of cycle (about 14th day). Rapid secretion of LH leading to
its maximum level during the mid-cycle called LH surge induces rupture
of Graafian follicle and thereby the release of ovum (<b>ovulation</b>). The
ovulation (ovulatory phase) is followed by the luteal phase during which
the remaining parts of the Graafian follicle transform as the <B>corpus
luteum</B> (Figure 3.9). The corpus luteum secretes large amounts of
progesterone which is essential for maintenance of the endometrium.
Such an endometrium is necessary for implantation of the fertilised
ovum and other events of pregnancy. During pregnancy all events of
the menstrual cycle stop and there is no menstruation. In the absence
of fertilisation, the corpus luteum degenerates. This causes disintegration
of the endometrium leading to menstruation, marking a new cycle. In
human beings, menstrual cycles ceases around 50 years of age; that is
termed as <b>menopause</b>. Cyclic menstruation is an indicator of normal
reproductive phase and extends between menarche and menopause.
