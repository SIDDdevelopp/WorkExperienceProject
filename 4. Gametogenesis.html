        <P>The primary sex organs – the testis in the males and the ovaries in the
            females – produce gametes, i.e, sperms and ovum, respectively, by the
            process called gametogenesis. In testis, the immature male germ cells
            (spermatogonia) produce sperms by <b>spermatogenesis</b> that begins at
            puberty. The <b>spermatogonia</b> (sing. spermatogonium) present on the
            inside wall of seminiferous tubules multiply by mitotic division and
            increase in numbers. Each spermatogonium is diploid and contains 46
            chromosomes. Some of the spermatogonia called <b>primary
            spermatocytes</b> periodically undergo meiosis. A primary spermatocyte
            completes the first meiotic division (reduction division) leading to
            <img class="img_right" src="images/Fig. 3.5.PNG" alt="Fig. 3.5">
            formation of two equal, haploid cells called
            <b>secondary spermatocytes</b>, which have only
            23 chromosomes each. The secondary
            spermatocytes undergo the second meiotic
            division to produce four equal, haploid
            <b>spermatids</b> (Figure 3.5). <i>What would be the
            number of chromosome in the spermatids?</i>
            The spermatids are transformed into
            <b>spermatozoa (sperms)</b> by the process called
            <b>spermiogenesis</b>. After spermiogenesis,
            sperm heads become embedded in the
            <b>Sertoli cells</b>, and are finally released from
            the seminiferous tubules by the process
            called <b>spermiation</b>.<br>
            Spermatogenesis starts at the age of
    puberty due to significant increase in the
    secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone
    (GnRH). This, if you recall, is a hypothalamic hormone. The increased
    levels of GnRH then acts at the anterior pituitary gland and stimulates
    secretion of two gonadotropins – luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle
    stimulating hormone (FSH). LH acts at the Leydig cells and stimulates
    synthesis and secretion of androgens. Androgens, in turn, stimulate the
    process of spermatogenesis. FSH acts on the Sertoli cells and stimulates
    secretion of some factors which help in the
    process of spermiogenesis.<br>

    Let us examine the structure of a sperm. It
is a microscopic structure composed of a <b>head,
neck,</b> a <b>middle piece</b> and a <b>tail</b> (Figure 3.6). A
plasma membrane envelops the whole body of
sperm. The sperm head contains an elongated
haploid nucleus, the anterior portion of which
is covered by a cap-like structure, <b>acrosome</b>.
The acrosome is filled with enzymes that help
fertilisation of the ovum. The middle piece
possesses numerous mitochondria, which
produce energy for the movement of tail that
facilitate sperm motility essential for fertilisation.
The human male ejaculates about 200 to 300
million sperms during a coitus of which, for
normal fertility, at least 60 per cent sperms
must have normal shape and size and at least
40 per cent of them must show vigorous
motility.<br>
Sperms released from the seminiferous
tubules, are transported by the accessory
ducts. Secretions of epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicle and
prostate are essential for maturation and motility of sperms. The seminal
plasma along with the sperms constitute the <b>semen</b>. The functions of
male sex accessory ducts and glands are maintained by the testicular
hormones (androgens).<br>
The process of formation of a mature female gamete is called <b>oogenesis</b>
which is markedly different from spermatogenesis. Oogenesis is initiated
during the embryonic development stage when a couple of million gamete
mother cells <b>(oogonia)</b> are formed within each fetal ovary; no more oogonia
are formed and added after birth. These cells start division and enter into
prophase-I of the meiotic division and get temporarily arrested at that stage,
called <b>primary oocytes</b>. Each primary oocyte then gets surrounded by a
layer of granulosa cells and is called the <b>primary follicle</b> (Figure 3.7). A
large number of these follicles degenerate during the phase from birth to
puberty. Therefore, at puberty only 60,000-80,000 primary follicles are
left in each ovary. The primary follicles get surrounded by more layers of
granulosa cells and a new theca and are called <b>secondary follicles</b>.<br>
<img src="images/Fig. 3.7.PNG" class="img_right" alt="Fig. 3.7">
The secondary follicle soon transforms into a tertiary follicle which is
characterised by a fluid filled cavity called <b>antrum</b>. The theca layer is
organised into an inner theca interna and an outer theca externa. It is
important to draw your attention that it is at this stage that the primary
oocyte within the tertiary follicle grows in size and completes its first meiotic
division. It is an unequal division resulting in the formation of a large
haploid <b>secondary oocyte</b> and a tiny first polar body (Figure 3.8b). The
secondary oocyte retains bulk of the
nutrient rich cytoplasm of the primary
oocyte. <i>Can you think of any advantage
for this?</i> Does the first polar body born
out of first meiotic division divide further
or degenerate? At present we are not
very certain about this. The tertiary
follicle further changes into the mature
follicle or <b>Graafian follicle</b> (Figure 3.7).
The secondary oocyte forms a new
membrane called <b>zona pellucida</b>
surrounding it. The Graafian follicle now
ruptures to release the secondary oocyte
(ovum) from the ovary by the
process called <b>ovulation</b>. Can you
identify major differences between
<i>spermatogenesis</i> and <i>oogenesis</i>? A diagrammatic representation of
spermatogenesis and oogenesis is given below (Figure 3.8).<br><br>
