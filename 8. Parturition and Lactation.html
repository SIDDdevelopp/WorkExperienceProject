        <p>The average duration of human pregnancy is about 9 months
            which is called the gestation period. Vigorous contraction of the uterus at
            the end of pregnancy causes expulsion/delivery of the foetus. This process
            of delivery of the foetus (childbirth) is called <b>parturition</b>. Parturition is
            induced by a complex neuroendocrine mechanism. The signals for
            parturition originate from the fully developed foetus and the placenta
            which induce mild uterine contractions called <b>foetal ejection reflex</b>. This
            triggers release of oxytocin from the maternal pituitary. Oxytocin acts on
            the uterine muscle and causes stronger uterine contractions, which in
            turn stimulates further secretion of oxytocin. The stimulatory reflex between
            the uterine contraction and oxytocin secretion continues resulting in
            stronger and stronger contractions. This leads to expulsion of the baby
            out of the uterus through the birth canal – parturition. Soon after the
            infant is delivered, the placenta is also expelled out of the uterus. <i>What do
            you think the doctors inject to induce delivery?</i><br>
            The mammary glands of the female undergo differentiation during
pregnancy and starts producing milk towards the end of pregnancy by
the process called <b>lactation</b>. This helps the mother in feeding the new-born. The milk produced during the initial few days of lactation is called
<b>colostrum</b> which contains several antibodies absolutely essential to
develop resistance for the new-born babies. Breast-feeding during the
initial period of infant growth is recommended by doctors for bringing up
a healthy baby.<br>
