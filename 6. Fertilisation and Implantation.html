        <h1 align="center"><u>3.5 FERTILISATION AND IMPLANTATION</u></h1><br>
        <p>During copulation (coitus) semen is released by the penis into the vagina
            (insemination). The motile sperms swim rapidly, pass through the cervix,
            enter into the uterus and finally reach the ampullary region of the
            fallopian tube (Figure 3.11b). The ovum released by the ovary is also
            transported to the ampullary region
            where fertilisation takes place.
            Fertilisation can only occur if the
            ovum and sperms are transported
            simultaneously to the ampullary
            region. This is the reason why not all
            copulations lead to fertilisation and
            pregnancy.<br>
            The process of fusion of a sperm
            with an ovum is called <b>fertilisation</b>.
            During fertilisation, a sperm comes in
            contact with the <i>zona pellucida</i> layer
            of the ovum (Figure 3.10) and induces
            changes in the membrane that block
            the entry of additional sperms.<br>

            Thus, it ensures that only one sperm can
            fertilise an ovum. The secretions of the
            acrosome help the sperm enter into the
            cytoplasm of the ovum through the
            zona pellucida and the plasma
            membrane. This induces the completion of the meiotic division of the
            secondary oocyte. The second meiotic division is also unequal and results
            in the formation of a <b>second polar body</b> and a haploid ovum (ootid). Soon
            the haploid nucleus of the sperms and that of the ovum fuse together to
            form a diploid <b>zygote</b>. <i>How many chromosomes will be there in the zygote?</i><br>
            One has to remember that the sex of the baby has been decided at this
            stage itself. Let us see how? As you know the chromosome pattern in the
            human female is XX and that in the male is XY. Therefore, all the haploid
            gametes produced by the female (ova) have the sex chromosome X whereas
            in the male gametes (sperms) the sex chromosome could be either X or Y,
            hence, 50 per cent of sperms carry the X chromosome while the other 50 per
            cent carry the Y. After fusion of the male and female gametes the zygote
            would carry either XX or XY depending on whether the sperm carrying X
            or Y fertilised the ovum. The zygote carrying XX would develop into a female
            baby and XY would form a male (you will learn more about the chromosomal
            patterns in Chapter 5). <i>That is why, scientifically it is correct to say that the
                sex of the baby is determined by the father and not by the mother!</i><br>

            The mitotic division starts as the zygote moves through the isthmus
            of the oviduct called <b>cleavage</b> towards the uterus (Figure 3.11) and forms
            2, 4, 8, 16 daughter cells called <b>blastomeres</b>.<br>
            The embryo with 8 to 16
            blastomeres is called a morula (Figure 3.11e). The morula continues to
            divide and transforms into blastocyst (Figure 3.11g) as it moves further
            into the uterus. The blastomeres in the blastocyst are arranged into an
            outer layer called <b>trophoblast</b> and an inner group of cells attached to
            trophoblast called the <b>inner cell</b> mass. The trophoblast layer then gets
            attached to the endometrium and the inner cell mass gets differentiated
            as the embryo. After attachment, the uterine cells divide rapidly and covers
            the blastocyst. As a result, the blastocyst becomes embedded in the
            endometrium of the uterus (Figure 3.11h). This is called <b>implantation</b>
            and it leads to pregnancy.</p><br>
