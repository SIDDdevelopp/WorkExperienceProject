        <h1 align="center"><u>3.2 THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM</u></h1><br>
        <p>The female reproductive system consists of a pair of <b>ovaries</b> alongwith a pair
            of <b>oviducts, uterus, cervix, vagina</b> and the <b>external genitalia</b> located in
            pelvic region (Figure 3.3a). These parts of the system alongwith a pair of the
            <b>mammary glands</b> are integrated structurally and functionally to support
            the processes of ovulation, fertilisation, pregnancy, birth and child care.<br>
            Ovaries are the primary female sex organs that produce the female
            gamete (ovum) and several steroid hormones (ovarian hormones).
            The ovaries are located one on each side of the lower abdomen
            (Figure 3.3b). Each ovary is about 2 to 4 cm in length and is connected to
            the pelvic wall and uterus by ligaments. Each ovary is covered by a thin
            epithelium which encloses the ovarian stroma. The stroma is divided into
            two zones : a peripheral cortex and an inner medulla.</p>
            <p>The oviducts (fallopian tubes), uterus and vagina constitute the female
                accessory ducts. Each fallopian tube is about 10-12 cm long and extends
            from the periphery of each ovary to the uterus (Figure 3.3b), the part closer
            to the ovary is the funnel-shaped <b>infundibulum</b>. The edges of the
            infundibulum possess finger-like projections called <b>fimbriae</b>, which help in
            collection of the ovum after ovulation. The infundibulum leads to a wider part of the oviduct called <b>ampulla</b>.
            The last part of the oviduct, <b>isthmus</b> has
            a narrow lumen and it joins the uterus.<br>
            The uterus is single and it is also called <b>womb</b>. The shape of the uterus
            is like an inverted pear. It is supported by ligaments attached to the pelvic
            wall. The uterus opens into vagina through a narrow cervix. The cavity of
            the cervix is called <b>cervical canal</b> (Figure 3.3b) which alongwith vagina
            forms the birth canal. The wall of the uterus has three layers of tissue. The
            external thin membranous <b>perimetrium</b>, middle thick layer of smooth
            muscle, <b>myometrium</b> and inner glandular layer called <b>endometrium</b> that
            lines the uterine cavity. The endometrium undergoes cyclical changes during
            menstrual cycle while the myometrium exhibits strong contraction during
            delivery of the baby.</p>

        <p>The female external genitalia include mons pubis, labia majora, labia
            minora, hymen and clitoris (Figure 3.3a). <b>Mons pubis</b> is a cushion of fatty
            tissue covered by skin and pubic hair. The <b>labia majora</b> are fleshy folds of
            tissue, which extend down from the mons pubis and surround the vaginal
            opening. The <b>labia minora</b> are paired folds of tissue under the labia majora.
            The opening of the vagina is often covered partially by a membrane called
            <b>hymen</b>. The <b>clitoris</b> is a tiny finger-like structure which lies at the upper
            junction of the two labia minora above the urethral opening. The hymen is
            often torn during the first coitus (intercourse).<i> However, it can also be broken
            by a sudden fall or jolt, insertion of a vaginal tampon, active participation
            in some sports like horseback riding, cycling, etc. In some women the hymen
            persists even after coitus. In fact, the presence or absence of hymen is not
            a reliable indicator of virginity or sexual experience.</i><br>

            A functional mammary gland is characteristic of all female mammals.
            The mammary glands are paired structures (breasts) that contain
            glandular tissue and variable amount of fat. The glandular tissue of each
            breast is divided into 15-20 <b>mammary lobes</b> containing clusters of cells
            called alveoli (Figure 3.4). The cells of alveoli secrete milk, which is stored
            in the cavities (lumens) of alveoli. The alveoli open into mammary tubules.
            The tubules of each lobe join to form a <b>mammary duct</b>. Several mammary
            ducts join to form a wider mammary ampulla which is connected to
            <b>lactiferous duct</b> through which milk is sucked out.
