        <p>After implantation, finger-like projections appear on the trophoblast called
            <b>chorionic villi</b> which are surrounded by the uterine tissue and maternal
            blood. The chorionic villi and uterine tissue become interdigitated with
            each other and jointly form a structural and functional unit between
            developing embryo (foetus) and maternal body called <b>placenta</b> (Figure 3.12).<br>
            <img class="img_right" src="images/Fig. 3.12.PNG" alt="Fig. 3.12">
            The placenta facilitate the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the
embryo and also removal of carbon dioxide and excretory/waste materials
produced by the embryo. The placenta is connected to the embryo through
an umbilical cord which helps in the transport of substances to and from
the embryo. Placenta also acts as an endocrine tissue and produces
several hormones like <b>human chorionic gonadotropin</b> (hCG), <b>human
    placental lactogen</b> (hPL), <b>estrogens, progestogens</b>, etc. In the later
phase of pregnancy, a hormone called <b>relaxin</b> is also secreted by
the ovary. Let us remember
that hCG, hPL and relaxin
are produced in women
only during pregnancy. In
addition, during pregnancy
the levels of other hormones
like estrogens, progestogens,
cortisol, prolactin, thyroxine,
etc., are increased several-folds in the maternal blood. 
Increased production of these
hormones is essential for
supporting the fetal growth,
metabolic changes in the
mother and maintenance of
pregnancy.<br>
Immediately after
implantation, the inner cell
mass (embryo) differentiates into an outer layer called <b>ectoderm</b> and an inner layer called <b>endoderm</b>. A
<b>mesoderm</b> soon appears between the ectoderm and the endoderm. These
three layers give rise to all tissues (organs) in adults. It needs to be mentioned
here that the inner cell mass contains certain cells called <b>stem</b> cells which
have the potency to give rise to all the tissues and organs.<br>
<i>What are the major features of embryonic development at various
months of pregnancy?</i> The human pregnancy lasts 9 months. <i>Do you
know for how many months pregnancy last in dogs, elephants, cats?</i>
Find out. In human beings, after one month of pregnancy, the embryo's
heart is formed. The first sign of growing foetus may be noticed by listening
to the heart sound carefully through the stethoscope. By the end of the
second month of pregnancy, the foetus develops limbs and digits. By the
end of 12 weeks (first trimester), most of the major organ systems are
formed, for example, the limbs and external genital organs are well-developed. The first movements of the foetus and appearance of hair on
the head are usually observed during the fifth month. By the end of about
24 weeks (end of second trimester), the body is covered with fine hair,
eye-lids separate, and eyelashes are formed. By the end of nine months
of pregnancy, the foetus is fully developed and is ready for delivery.<br>
